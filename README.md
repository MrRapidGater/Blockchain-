# There are two projects in this section. 

The objective of the first is to experiment with smart contracts by developing a smart contract based banking system. 

The second deals with implementing a Double Auction algorithm.

The basic idea is that you have a market â€“ a forum where people wish to buy and sell items. The people
trading in these items will submit their bids i.e. the price at which they are willing to buy
or sell these items. These bids are submitted to a market institution or marketplace.
This marketplace must match the sell bids and the buy bids. It collects bids in a time interval called the Auction interval. At the end of
Auction Interval, the market picks a price called the market clearing price. This clearing
price has some criteria but the most important is that no one trades their item at a loss.
